# Note Taker

An application for saving and organizing notes. Can create, edit, and delete notes and is updated on the server. Each note is saved in the db.json file and given a unique id with the UUID package. Version 4 is used for IDs so they are certainly unique and have no chance of having duplicates. Express is used for the server framework and for the get / post / delete requests. Also has api routes setup for users to interact with the backend. Website is hosted with Heroku
