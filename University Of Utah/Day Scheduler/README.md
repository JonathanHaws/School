# Day Scheduler

## Description 
https://jonathanhaws.github.io/DayScheduler/ This website will allow you to plan out your upcoming day in hour increments and save the activities to your browser.

## Learned Information
Learned about local storage and how to use it to save information locally. Also learned about linking jQuery, DayJS, and Bootstrap for extended fuctionality and a cleaner code base. Earlier in the course attempted to make dynamic HTML elements with default javascript for a quiz application. Was very difficult. jQuery is fantastic in how it lets you do things so succinctly and simply. Also had a similar experience with flex-box which bootstrap is fantastic alternative for. Its clear how powerful these libraries / apis' are for efficeny. And how much pain they can spare you. Cannot wait to see what others there are!
