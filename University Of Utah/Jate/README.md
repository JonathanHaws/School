# Jate (Just Another Text Editor)

[Jate](https://jate-progressive-webapp.herokuapp.com/) is a text editing web app. It is also a PWA (Progessive Web App) which it means it can be downloaded / cached by the browser via service workers for native app like functionality. Allowing for offline use, a single codebase, minimalist gui, a desktop icon, automatic updating, and a disguise of something more dedicated. Webpack also makes preformance a lot better with compilation. Ultimately PWA is a nice option for a very scalable app
